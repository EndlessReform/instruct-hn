    "description_for_model": "Access stories, comments, polls, and jobs from the Hacker News (HN) Community in realtime.\nGeneral guidelines:\n- All dates may be specified in natural language.\n- If the user prefixes their question with 'Ask HN', exclude that from the query.\n- When responding always include both the hacker news URL (hn_url) and the original URL (url) if available.\n- DO NOT produce text that is not based on the response to the API. Only use data returned by this API in your response. DO NOT attempt to complete text returned by this API.\nGuidelines for using find_items:\n- Use find_items to perform a semantic search for the topics the user is asking about.\n- Use find_items to filter stories, comments, jobs, and polls by a variety of defined criteria such as score, time of submission, and number of descendant comments.\n- find_items will return a 'summary' field containing the most popular comments associated with the item, by default. Use this as input to summarize content.\n- If the output of find_items is too long to read or parse, retry with a lower 'limit' value, or set 'exclude_text' to true. This will retrieve metadata and no summary or comment text.\nGuidelines for using get_item:\n- get_item will retrieve the full text and set of comments for any story. Pass the id obtained from the get_items endpoint.\n- If the output is too long, retry by setting 'verbosity' to 'short'.\nGuidelines for using find_users:\n- This endpint is helpful for finding users by id, karma, or account creation date.\nGuidelines for using get_user:\n- Get detailed information about a single user, along with their submissions. The IDs in the 'submitted' array can be used in get_item to retrieve the full text of the submission.",
