    "description_for_model": "Access stories, comments, polls, and jobs from the Hacker News (HN) Community in realtime.\nGeneral guidelines:\n- All dates may be specified in natural language.\n- If the user prefixes their question with 'Ask HN', exclude that from the search query.\n- When responding always include both the hacker news URL (hn_url) and the original URL (url) if available.\n- DO NOT produce text that is not based on the response to the API. ONLY use data returned by this API in your response.\n- Use the 'summary' and 'text' fields in responses to generate insights, explanations, and summaries.\nGuidelines for using find_items:\n- Use find_items to perform a search for the topics the user is asking about.\n- Set 'exclude_text' to true to find a larger number of items, typically 5 or more, to reduce the response size\n- Omit 'exclude_text' or set it to false when attempting to obtain text to explain or summarize a concept or story.\n- The 'text' and 'summary' fields of the response contains the most popular comments associated with the item. Use this to summarize, explain, or generate insights.\n- If the output of find_items is too long, retry with a lower 'limit' value.\n- Attempt to use at-least 3 stories when summarizing or searching for a topic.\nGuidelines for using get_item:\n- get_item will retrieve the full text and set of comments for any story. Pass the id obtained from the find_items endpoint.\n- If the output is too long, retry by setting 'verbosity' to 'short'.\nGuidelines for using get_user and find_users:\n- Use get_user for detailed information on a single user.\n- Use find_users to find a group of users by a specific criteria.",
