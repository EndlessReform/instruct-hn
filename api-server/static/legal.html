    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information for the
        Hacker News ChatGPT Plugin ("the Plugin"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using the Plugin. By
        using the Plugin, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms, please do
        not use the Plugin.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Plugin utilizes publicly available user-generated data from Hacker News. By using the Plugin, you
        acknowledge and agree that your use of Hacker News is also subject to the Hacker News Terms of Service and
        Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="https://ycombinator.com/legal">https://ycombinator.com/legal</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        The only data we collect from users of the plugin are the API parameters submitted to our server by ChatGPT
        or the demo web page. This may include parts of the question you submitted to either service. We do not collect
        any personal information or identifiers about users, such as names, email addresses, IP addresses, or any other
        information that could be used to identify individuals. We do not store any additional information about the
        queries or the users who submit them. The anonymous query data is only retained for a limited period of time
        to provide and improve the service.
    </p>
    <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <p>
        We use the anonymized query data solely for the purpose of processing and generating responses within the
        Plugin, and for improving the service for everyone over time. We do not use this data for any other purposes,
        such as advertising, marketing, or profiling users.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <p>
        We do not share or sell the anonymized query data to any third parties. We will only disclose the data if
        required by law, in response to a valid court order, or to protect our rights, property, or safety or the
        rights, property, or safety of others.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take appropriate measures to protect the security of the anonymized query data. While we strive to protect
        your information, no method of data transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the
        absolute security of the information we collect.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes to this Privacy Policy
